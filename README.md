### Hello!

I'm a software developer with an interest in back-end work and cloud deployments.

Here are some of the skills I've gained over time along with tech I've worked with (no claims of proficiency):

- Languages: Go, Python, JavaScript (NodeJS), C, Java
- Frameworks: React, Operator SDK
- Testing Frameworks: Pytest, JUnit, Selenium
- Infrastructure: Kubernetes, Docker
- Databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- Tools: kustomize, helm, git
- Other: Jenkins (pipelines / Jenkinsfiles)

Things I want to learn more about:
- GitOps philosophy
- ArgoCD
- Github Actions
- Kubernetes architecture & scalability
